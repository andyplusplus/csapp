study the machine-level representation of generated code

* mstore.c  p172

** to generate assembly code
     gcc -Og -S mstore.c

** to generate object code
     gcc -Og -c mstore.c
     hexl-find-file
** to dissamble code
     objdump -d mstore.o



* exchange.c p187
  I have listed two approach to generate assembly file:
    1) by exchangemake-Og.sh ==> exchange-187-disamb-Og.s   
             -O -O1: optimize,  -g: include debug info
             -Og: Optimize debugging experience.
    2) by exchangemake.sh ==> exchange-187-disamb.s
    3) by gcc -s exchange.c ==> exchange-187.s
